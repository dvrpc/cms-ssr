      <h2>Title VI Statement</h2>
      <p>In effect as of January 30, 2025</p>
      <p>
        The Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) fully complies
        with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights
        Restoration Act of 1987, and related nondiscrimination mandates in all
        programs and activities. DVRPC is committed to ensuring that no person
        is excluded from participation in, or denied the benefits of, all
        programs and activities on the basis of race, creed, color, national
        origin, age, gender, disability, sexual orientation, or income level, as
        protected by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other related
        nondiscrimination mandates.
