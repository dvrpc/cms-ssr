DVARP denounced this project in LinkedIn commentary and was advised to officially comment on the project.<br/><br/>The purpose of the Glassboro Multi-Purpose Rail Extension – Glassboro – Elk Trail is to extend an existing bike/walking trail that occupies the right-of-way of a former railroad, the Williamstown Railroad, which eventually came under control/ownership of the Philadelphia and Atlantic City Railroad and later the Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines (Railroad).  <br/><br/>The Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines progressively took out of service portions of the former Williamstown Railroad between 1932 and 1968, at which time only stubs of the branch remained in service to serve industries at Glassboro, Williamstown, and Williamstown Junction.  <br/><br/>The Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines was absorbed into ConRail in 1976; ConRail eventually abandoned the remaining industrial spurs and the rights-of-way transferred to local and state governments or private owners.  The right-of-way between Glassboro Junction and Blue Bell Road in Williamstown remains largely intact.  While some of it has already been turned into a rail trail, some remains undisturbed.<br/><br/>Since 1968, the population of Gloucester County has grown by fifty-eight percent (58%), particularly spurred by commercial and residential development in and around Glassboro and Williamstown.  Both areas are currently underserved by transit, have high rates of traffic congestion, and few options to reduce expand roadway capacity.<br/><br/>The Delaware Valley Association of Rail Passengers believes the conversion of the former Williamstown Railroad right-of-way into a rail trail, bike trail, etc. is poor judgement, does not and will not serve the greater good, and will contribute to congestion in the region. <br/><br/>Currently, a major light rail system is being developed to serve over the existing Millville Secondary Division, owned by ConRail between Camden and Glassboro.  DVARP believes, and has historically supported, that the former Williamstown Railroad right-of-way be preserved intact for the restoration of a future passenger rail extension from Glassboro Junction.  The reinstitution of passenger rail services, be it heavy rail or light rail, will serve a far greater number of people, open the region to new commercial and economic investments and development, assist in traffic congestion reduction, and reduce pollution.  The rail trail investment fails to achieve many of the above goals.  <br/><br/>DVARP does not oppose rail trails in a broader sense as not all former railroad rights-of-way remain useful for freight or passenger service.  DVARP fiercely opposes this proposal as it fails to consider the broader needs of sprawl issues, development patterns, congestion, pollution, and lack of ability to expand other means of transportation, especially single occupancy vehicles (SOV).", "MPMS":"<a href = 'https://www.dvrpc.org/tip/draft/map/D1203'> D1203</a> Gloucester County Multi-Purpose Trail Extension - Glassboro Elk Trail&nbsp;&nbsp;", "FILELINK2":"", "Responses":"<div class='card'> <div class='mycard-header'> <b>MPMSID #:  D1203 Gloucester County Multi-Purpose Trail Extension - Glassboro Elk Trail</b></div><div class='mycard-body'><b><i>Response By Gloucester County</i></b><div>Gloucester County acknowledges your comment and is happy to report the proposed project is no longer utilizing the old rail bed as originally proposed due to private land owner acquisition of the old right-of-way.

I myself rely frequently on cycling trails accessible from Trenton in Mercer and Burlington counties in New Jersey and across the river in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.<br/><br/><br/>It is gratifying to see the Johnson Trolley Trail Corridor in Mercer County on the actionable list for the Transportation Improvement Program. The specific element of the trolley trail considered in the TIP currently before the Regional Planning Commission is a bridge across Interstate Route 295 in Lawrence Township to link the northern and southern segments of the trail that were severed by construction of the interstate road a half-century ago. It deserves priority, as a crucial step toward realizing the ambitious and achievable goal of a bike trail that links the monuments to the twin decisive battles of Trenton and Princeton that saved the American Revolution a quarter-millennium ago.

The specific element of the trolley trail <br/><br/><br/>considered in the TIP currently before the Regional Planning Commission <br/><br/><br/>is a bridge across Interstate Route 295 in Lawrence Township to link the <br/><br/><br/>northern and southern segments of the trail that were severed by <br/><br/><br/>construction of the interstate road a half-century ago.

I urge the Commission board to <br/><br/><br/>include in the TIP the design work for the southern segment (from the <br/><br/><br/>trail's intersection with Spruce Street in Ewing south to connect to the <br/><br/><br/>Delaware and Raritan Canal path at Southard Street in Trenton and on to <br/><br/><br/>the Trenton Battle Monument).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The Rancocas Greenway projects will also be important in moving toward <br/><br/><br/>completion of the 41 miles of Circuit Trails envisioned for the southern <br/><br/><br/>half of the State, and in particular the Delaware River Heritage Trail <br/><br/><br/><https://www.delawarerivergreenwaypartnership.org/index.php/publications/heritage-trail/state-of-the-trail-report>Â piece <br/><br/><br/>of the East Coast Greenway.

I am also the author of our town's history book, 'West Windsor Then and Now - A New Perspective.' Project 17419 naturally affects the historic mid-1700s community of Penns Neck. This neighborhood is well-documented by the Historical Society of West Windsor and is one of the oldest communities within the entire township. Much of its extant historic character dates to the 1920s and beyond, but several properties do date to the early-mid 1800s, and one - the Schenck-Covenhoven Cemetery, about 1/3 mile north of the traffic circle intersection - is from the 1730s or 1740s. See the Historical Society's website(https://www.westwindsorhistory.com/pennsneck.html) which contains histories of several dozen sites (both disappeared and extant) within that community. Project 17419 is of particular attention to the Historical Society because of potential impacts on the historic character of Penns Neck community. In particular, we strongly support that whatever the end result be, that it (including entrances/exits to the circle) not encroach on the property owned by the Princeton Baptist Church. This includes the church sanctuary building itself (const. 1812) and the Red Lion Inn (const. 1807 - the house just behind and next to the AT&T store; it hasn't functioned as a tavern since the 1870s but remains a historic site). I believe the AT&T store is also owned by the Church. Both the sanctuary and the Red Lion Inn are listed on the New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places for their architectural and social significance (too detailed to expound upon here but see the link above for more info). They carry vital significance to the Penns Neck neighborhood as historic sites (and the Church is still used as a spiritual and social gathering place for many). They are also of importance to West Windsor more broadly as a symbol of local history. The Historical Society has significantly more information on their history and significance than what is posted on our website, so for even more, email us at westwindsorhistory@gmail.com or call us at (609) 751-4061. We would also like to suggest that signage be installed as part of the project on all approaches to the Washington Road traffic circle and/or Fisher Place, saying 'Welcome to historic Penns Neck' or similar. There already is similar signage on Route 1 southbound, just south of Eden Way's exit onto Route 1, but it is old and fading and would ideally be replaced. The Historical Society already has a cast-metal sign providing a brief overview of the community's history along Washington Road (next to the Princeton Baptist Church's graveyard).", "MPMS":"<a href = 'https://www.dvrpc.org/tip/draft/map/17419'> 17419</a> Route   1, Alexander Road to Mapleton Road&nbsp;&nbsp;", "FILELINK2":"", "Responses":"<div class='card'> <div class='mycard-header'> <b>MPMSID #:  17419 Route   1, Alexander Road to Mapleton Road</b></div><div class='mycard-body'><b><i>Response By NJDOT</i></b><div>Thank you for your comment; it will be shared with \\\\[other\\\\] NJDOT staff.

And I understand that it's busy. But I am concerned that the widening will just bring more traffic, thanks to induced demand, and that the extra lane will mean higher speeds. And in the end, more crashes and more fatalities. In addition, I fear it will bring more traffic in front of homes on both Washington Road and Fisher Place that people use to reach U.S. 1.<br/><br/><br/>I'm also concerned that it will become even more difficult for non-motorists to cross U.S. 1. Right now it's doable at Washington Road (take your place in line, cyclists ... better than trying Alexander Road with no shoulder/bike lane and fast-moving traffic). I wish the Princeton University path that comes almost to the Fisher Place jughandle could connect -- that seems like a calmer way to cross U.S. 1 for those on bikes as well as those on foot.<br/><br/><br/>8 lanes is a lot of highway dividing parts of my town.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>There's already no way for those staying at the hotels opposite the hospital in Plainsboro to cross US 1 -- has there been any thought to <br/><br/>adding a pedestrian bridge? I realize this is just north of Mapleton, so you may tell me this is out of the project scope. But I hope it is then somewhere on your radar.<br/><br/><br/>Finally, more of U.S. 1 needs sidewalks or multi-use paths, preferably set back from these 8 lanes of dangerous traffic. A sidewalk was added along U.S. 1 between Emmons Drive and Nassau Park as well as south of the Mercer One shopping center (where Shop-Rite is), and I see workers and others using it. Please anticipate the redevelopment of the SRI site by adding safe sidewalks on the eastern side that can connect to whatever goes there.<br/><br/><br/>Give people choices about how to move around!<br/><br/><br/>I hope that NJDOT can share its concept plans and drawings with residents early in the process -- to gain input, to make sensible changes and to avoid last-minute uproars that could squander a lot of work.

Tractor trailer traffic has increased substantially on Bordentown area highways and secondary roads due to recent warehouse construction and the quick highway access afforded by proximity to Routes I-295, I-195, I-276, NJ Turnpike, and  Routes US-130 and US-206.   Truck traffic increasingly uses secondary roads to transit from one highway to another.  This is unacceptable given residential areas are immediately adjacent to these highways.  Current efforts to keep truck traffic off secondary roads, consisting mainly of signage installed by DOT, have proven ineffective.  As a result, Bordentown City and Bordentown Township residents are increasingly isolated.  More effective traffic management and additional pedestrian/bicyclist paths and road crossing are required to reconnect communities on opposite sides of the highways.  Recommend better linkage between highways to keep trucks off secondary roads.  For example, there is a lack of a highway exit from I-295 South onto Rising Sun Road to access the large truck stop there.   Current truck stop signage on Rt 295 South directing tractor trailers to take Columbus exit or via Dunns Mill Road from Rt 130 South apparently are not being followed presumably because truck drivers are merely following their GPS mapping software directions.  Unfortunately, mapping software is routing the trucks onto secondary roads for short cuts as if they were cars.

However, improvements are needed to<br/><br/><br/>effectively link these regional trails including, and BTC is asking the TIP<br/><br/><br/>to include:<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Â·        Creating a proper trail head for D & R Canal Tow Path at the Foot<br/><br/><br/>of Farnsworth Ave.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Â·        Building a proper trail extension to connect D & R Canal State<br/><br/><br/>Park (tow path trail) to Delaware River Heritage trail - likely along the<br/><br/><br/>River Line rail adjacent to the yacht club<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Â·        Re-routing Delaware River Heritage Trail to an off-road trail<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>BTC also asks the TIP to support funding to begin construction of John Bull<br/><br/><br/>Trail in Mercer County, and to conduct feasibility study for the still<br/><br/><br/>active rail from Hamilton to Bordentown City - this is doubly important to<br/><br/><br/>create a safe and protected bike/pedestrian crossing over Rt 206, and to<br/><br/><br/>determine how this ârail trailâ can be built to preserve and highlight the<br/><br/><br/>significance of the historic Camden and Amboy Railroad.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>6) BTC fully supports the existing project DB# 12346 - Route 130/206, CR<br/><br/><br/>528 (Crosswicks Rd) to Rt 206 at Amboy Road to construct safer biking and<br/><br/><br/>pedestrian safety in Bordentown.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Â·        In addition to this existing project BTC would also like to see<br/><br/><br/>additional projects that focus on creating protected bike and pedestrian<br/><br/><br/>accommodations to cross routes 130/206 in Bordentown. Such projects could<br/><br/><br/>include retrofitting the existing railroad bridge over Rt 206 to allow use<br/><br/><br/>by bikers and pedestrians, or a newly constructed pedestrian bridge linking<br/><br/><br/>Bordentown City to Bordentown Township<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Â·        Bordentown City is surrounded by highways on all sides, namely Rt<br/><br/><br/>130, 206, and 295, and there is currently NO protected bike/pedestrian<br/><br/><br/>infrastructure surrounding Bordentown City. In this highly walkable<br/><br/><br/>community, there are only at-grade crossings of very busy highways using<br/><br/><br/>simple crosswalks. There have been instances of injuries and deaths to<br/><br/><br/>pedestrians in the past along these highway corridors, and improvements are<br/><br/><br/>needed above and beyond simple crosswalks.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>7) BTC supports projects DB #T05 and DB # 99372. In past TIP the<br/><br/><br/>replacement of the historic orphaned bridge on Farnsworth Ave over the<br/><br/><br/>Camden &amp; Amboy railroad was listed. However, the State of NJ has<br/><br/><br/>committed to rehabilitating that bridge to preserve its important historic<br/><br/><br/>significance.

New Jersey Future submits the following comments and recommendations for the draft NJ-TIP, organized by program and project:<br/><br/><br/>General Comments<br/><br/>● The Regional High Injury Network (RHIN) is the result of a data-driven process designed to map and identify where killed and severe injury crashes occurred, and where bicyclists and pedestrian crashes occurred. It helps prioritize safety improvements and investments in the most dangerous roadway segments to reduce traffic-related injuries and fatalities in the region.<br/><br/> ○ Any RHIN segments with an associated safety project should be added to the TIP.<br/><br/>○ Projects listed on the RHIN should note this in their project descriptions.<br/><br/>○ Projects on the RHIN should be required to implement proven safety countermeasures based on crash data.<br/><br/><br/>● Projects with significant bicycle and pedestrian improvements (i.e., addition of continuous sidewalks, bike lanes, or shared-use paths) should be noted as multimodal, so that it is clear that they include active transportation components.<br/><br/><br/>DB# X185 – Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities/Accommodations<br/><br/>● We strongly support the use of this program; however, the funding levels provided do not adequately meet the region’s needs.<br/><br/>○ This funding should be prioritized for projects on the RHIN to improve the safety of pedestrians on the most dangerous roadways in the region.<br/><br/><br/>DB# 22352 – Carbon Reduction Program<br/><br/><br/>● The Carbon Reduction Program is critical for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector. In New Jersey, the transportation sector accounts for 41% of the state’s total carbon emissions. To address this, NJ’s Carbon Reduction Strategy recommends increasing the use of public transit and active transportation to reduce emissions for the transportation sector. Both modes are clean and sustainable travel options that directly help reduce emissions.<br/><br/>○ Program funding should be directed toward increasing the use of public transit and active transportation, including regional trails, as<br/><br/>outlined in New Jersey’s Carbon Reduction Strategy.<br/><br/><br/>DB# 22355 – CMAQ Initiatives, Statewide<br/><br/>● Statewide trail networks are valuable assets that strengthen communities and support regional vitality. A statewide regional trail network is critical for offering residents a safe, sustainable, and accessible transportation facility that is consistent with the goals of the statewide Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) program.<br/><br/>○ A portion of the Statewide CMAQ funds should be allocated towards the creation of a statewide regional trail network.<br/><br/><br/>DB# X065 – CMAQ Initiatives, Local<br/><br/>● A portion of the local CMAQ funds should be allocated to Circuit Trails projects, as was done in 2018 and 2021.<br/><br/><br/>DB# X186B – Local Aid, State Transportation Infrastructure Bank<br/><br/>● Trails provide options for walking, biking, and rolling, connecting people to key destinations and fostering a sense of place. Beyond transportation, trails promote health, sustainability, and economic development, offering benefits that extend across urban, suburban, and rural landscapes.<br/><br/>○ Program funding from the New Jersey Transportation Infrastructure Bank should be increased to build more regional trails and shared-use paths.<br/><br/><br/>DB# X98Z – Local Aid, Urban Aid<br/><br/>● Funding for the Bikeways, Safe Streets to Transit, and Transit Village programs should be restored to their 2022-2025 funding levels.<br/><br/>○ For example, in 2021, the Bikeways program provided $1 million in funding for four projects, whereas in 2023, it provided $8.4 million in funding for seventeen projects.<br/><br/>○ Each of these programs plays a critical role in placemaking, enhancing active mobility and transit-oriented development, and, most<br/><br/>importantly, advancing the fight to end traffic-related deaths in New Jersey.<br/><br/><br/><br/>DB# X107 – Transportation Alternatives Program<br/><br/>● We strongly support the use of this program.<br/><br/>○ The redistribution of unobligated funds has been wisely spent on regional trail projects, and that process should continue.<br/><br/><br/>DB# 2403 – Camden LINK Trail<br/><br/>● We strongly support this project and believe it should be fully funded.<br/><br/>○ We are concerned that some of the federal funds could be rescinded, and any shortfall should be covered with other funding sources.<br/><br/>○ The Camden LINK Trail will be a vital active transportation facility safely connecting Philadelphia and the communities in Camden County.<br/><br/><br/>DB# 18305 – Prospect Street, Bridge over Belvidere-Delaware RR<br/><br/>● We support this project with additional bicycle and pedestrian improvements that are needed.<br/><br/>○ DVRPC’s bike plan for Trenton, “Our Streets: A Trenton Bike Plan for All,” recommends a two-way cycle track on Prospect Street that should be included.<br/><br/>○ Prospect Street is also on the RHIN, making it a priority corridor for pedestrian safety improvements.<br/><br/>○ Safe connections from Prospect Street to the Delaware and Raritan Canal State Park Trail need to be included.<br/><br/>○ Trail improvements, both under and adjacent to the bridge, should also be included.<br/><br/><br/>DB# 25381 – Johnson Trolley Pedestrian Bridge<br/><br/>● We strongly support this project and appreciate the commitment of NJDOT.<br/><br/>○ Please include the complete Johnson Trolley Trail Corridor proposed by the DVRPC-funded “Johnson Trolley Trail Corridor Study Feasibility and Concept Development Report.”<br/><br/>○ The pedestrian bridge over I-295 in Mercer County will provide a safe and accessible route for pedestrians and cyclists to cross the highway that has historically divided the community in half.<br/><br/><br/>DB# L064 – Route 206, South Broad Street Bridge over Assunpink Creek<br/><br/>● We support the project with additional bicycle and pedestrian improvements that are needed.<br/><br/>○ This bridge is part of the Delaware River Heritage Trail and is on the RHIN, making it a priority corridor for pedestrian safety improvements.<br/><br/>○ Protected bike lanes and ADA accessible sidewalks need to be included.<br/><br/><br/>DB# D2023 – Circulation Improvements Around Trenton Transit Center<br/><br/>● We strongly support this project.<br/><br/>○ The project would narrow the gap between the Delaware and Raritan<br/><br/>Canal Trail and the Trenton Transit Center, making it easier and safer for<br/><br/>pedestrians to access.<br/><br/><br/>DB# 19370 – Safety Programs, Hamilton Avenue between South Broad Street and South Olden Avenue<br/><br/>● We support this project with additional bicycle improvements that are needed.<br/><br/>○ DVRPC’s bike plan for Trenton, “Our Streets: A Trenton Bike Plan for All,” recommends a two-way cycle track on the street segment from Broad Street to Hudson Street that should be included.<br/><br/>DB# 19606 – Route 29, Route 295 to Sullivan Way, ATS C#1<br/><br/>● New Jersey Future has been working with Mercer County to advance the Route 29 local concept study to turn the roadway into a boulevard.<br/><br/>○ This project does not acknowledge this local concept development study for a boulevard, nor does it mention the inclusion of a shared-use path as part of the Delaware River Heritage Trail, which connects Trenton and Camden.<br/><br/><br/>● The traffic signal improvements and upgrades should include components and considerations that prioritize the safety of pedestrians and cyclists when crossing intersections along this segment of Route 29. The roadway is currently very hazardous for pedestrians and cyclists to cross; therefore, this project presents an opportunity to utilize traffic signal improvements to enhance safety. New Jersey Future commends DVRPC for creating the FFY2026 NJ-TIP, which will serve as a valuable resource for the region’s transportation priorities.
