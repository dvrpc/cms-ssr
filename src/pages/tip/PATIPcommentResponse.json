These comments represent my own views and not those of my employer or the EAC. I live in Lower Providence and frequently visit / traverse this area. <br/><br/><br/>This is a terrible project for the community. Collegeville, the West Ridge Pike neighborhood of Lower Providence, and the Evansburg neighborhood in Lower Providence are physically close enough to be walkable and bikable neighborhoods. This project doubles down on the car-dependence of this area by:<br/><br/><br/>- Almost doubling the width of Ridge Pike, creating more room for cars to speed, and longer pedestrian crossings. <br/><br/>- Providing pedestrian crossings on only two sides of the proposed very wide intersection at Ridge Pike and Crosskeys Road, and constructing a roundabout that appears to favor auto mobility over pedestrian / bike mobility at Germantown Pike and Crosskeys Road. I estimate it will take up to 10 minutes to wait for the light cycles and traversal time to pass at Ridge and Crosskeys, to go from one corner without crosswalks to the other, a situation which will tempt jaywalking and provide no dignity for pedestrians or bikers. <br/><br/>- Providing a sidewalk / trail on only one side of Ridge, which is NOT the side where most of the residents of the area live. <br/><br/>- Spending millions to shift the location of current automotive backups to a new location without alleviating the source of the bottleneck (the Perkiomen bridge). <br/><br/>- Put the long-term future of a historic bridge at risk. <br/><br/><br/>A much better approach would be to put Ridge Pike on a road diet from Route 29 in Collegeville to Evansburg Road / Level Road.

In alignment with the regional Vision for an equitable, resilient, and sustainable Greater Philadelphia, DVRPC strives for a safe, multimodal transportation network that serves everyone. Roadway system expansion projects have a higher level of review because of the impacts such projects have on our environment and communities. Roadway expansion projects need to be consistent with the region’s Congestion Management Process that identifies and limits where roadway widening is appropriate and requires consideration of other alternatives before widening. Acknowledging the impact of roadway widening projects and to ensure that there are sufficient funds to address preservation, multimodal, and other regional priorities; the DVRPC Connections 2050 Long-Range Plan limits expenditures on system expansion projects to no more than four percent of total roadway expenditures. <br/><br/><br/>The Pennsylvania TIP makes concrete investments toward a more sustainable future, with considerable funding allocated to transit, walking, and biking infrastructure. In the Pennsylvania state sub-region, approximately 44 percent of total funding (set through the federal legislative process) goes toward maintaining and improving transit infrastructure. However, at least one-third of all households and jobs in the Greater Philadelphia region lack reasonable access to transit. Ensuring that people and goods can safely and reliably move around the region is critical for quality of life, health and well-being, and the economy. <br/><br/><br/>For FHWA roadway funds allocated to the region, the priority is system preservation, which receives about 75 percent of total roadway funds anticipated through 2050. Roadway expansion projects that are included in the TIP primarily seek to correct past design flaws, remove bottlenecks, fill in missing links, and support economic development. Federal regulations require that alternatives to building new Single Occupancy Vehicle road capacity are explored first; where additional capacity is found to be appropriate and necessary, multimodal supplemental strategies to get the most long-term value from the investment must be included. Such strategies improve safety for pedestrians and bicyclists. The current TIP lists hundreds of projects eligible for federal funding, and nearly all of them contain bicycle and pedestrian components. Additionally, DVRPC has elected to cap its roadway expansion expenditures at four percent of total roadway funds in each state sub-region. <br/><br/><br/>DVRPC remains committed to improving the multimodal nature of transportation within Greater Philadelphia, and to responding to climate change by both lowering carbon emissions and adapting to climate change. In alignment with our region’s net zero greenhouse gas goal, DVRPC recommends a range of strategies, including increased land use density near transit, and updating zoning to support more mixed-use development to support more walkable and energy efficient communities; increasing access to safe pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure,  electrifying vehicles and all other equipment currently powered by fossil fuels;; and accelerating availability and the transition towards renewable energy.<br/><br/><br/>We have shared your comments with the DVRPC Regional Technical Committee (RTC) and Board in advance of discussions at their July meetings. We hope you will continue to provide valuable input into the Planning process by participating in public meetings, reviewing our website and publications, submitting comments on our plans and programs, or simply following us on social media.

For over a decade, the region has relied heavily on federal Transportation Alternatives Set-Aside (TASA or TAU) and Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funds to construct trail projects. As noted in your comments, the Draft FY2025 Pennsylvania TIP includes several large, county-led Circuit Trail projects, largely funded by the Carbon Reduction Program (CRP), a new federal formula program created by the IIJA/BIL that provides funding for projects designed to reduce transportation emissions. DVRPC’s Pennsylvania counties led the charge for this unprecedented investment in Circuit Trail projects to create a safe and efficient network for carbon-free travel. <br/><br/><br/>DVRPC applauds the counties and all the other stakeholders who are working hard to make the vision of the Circuit Trails network a reality.<br/><br/></div> <hr/><b><i>Response By Chester County</i></b><div>Thank you for your comments.

There were porta-potties at the<br/><br/><br/>SEPTA stations in Conshohocken, but they are no longer there and most<br/><br/><br/>people didn't even know about them.  Most people were urinating and<br/><br/><br/>defecating in the bushes alongside the trail since they didn't even<br/><br/><br/>know about those facilities, but after AMTRAK eliminated the vegetation<br/><br/><br/>alongside the trail along major expanses recently, those people don't<br/><br/><br/>have any privacy.  Conshohocken set aside $400K to build a washroom<br/><br/><br/>close to the SEPTA station there, but neighbors objected to having it.<br/><br/><br/>The new SEPTA station in Conshohocken has a couple nice washrooms, but<br/><br/><br/>it is closed much of the time and they don't want to open it even if<br/><br/><br/>Conshohocken pays to keep it open.  So it discourages a lot of people,<br/><br/><br/>like myself, from using the Schuylkill Valley Trail. It is especially<br/><br/><br/>discouraging for older people who may have bladder problems. Why it is<br/><br/><br/>that in the USA we have such a reluctance to build washroom facilities<br/><br/><br/>is beyond me and we remain so socially backward compared to many<br/><br/><br/>European countries it is ridiculous.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Mr. David Pratt<br/><br/><br/>28 Militia Hill Dr<br/><br/><br/>Chesterbrook, PA 19087-5846<br/><br/><br/>david.pratt14@verizon.net<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "MPMS":"", "FILELINK2":"", "Responses":"<div class='card'> <div class='mycard-header'> <b></b></div><div class='mycard-body'><b><i>Response By Bucks County</i></b><div>Thank you for your support.</div> <hr/><b><i>Response By DVRPC</i></b><div>Thank you for your support.

As noted in your comments, the Draft FY2025 Pennsylvania TIP includes several large, county-led Circuit Trail projects, largely funded by the Carbon Reduction Program (CRP), a new federal formula program created by the IIJA/BIL that provides funding for projects designed to reduce transportation emissions. DVRPC’s Pennsylvania counties led the charge for this unprecedented investment in Circuit Trail projects to create a safe and efficient network for carbon-free travel. <br/><br/><br/>DVRPC applauds the counties and all the other stakeholders who are working hard to make the vision of the Circuit Trails network a reality.<br/><br/></div> <hr/><b><i>Response By Chester County</i></b><div>Thank you for your comments.

The DVRPC region has made, and will continue to make, significant investments in bicycle and pedestrian improvements, through the collaboration of local and county governments, non-profits, foundations, and DOTs, including but not limited to the Circuit Trails network. <br/><br/><br/>The completed Circuit Trails are expected to be an 800-mile network, about half of which is currently completed and open. Over the years, DVRPC’s Regional Trails Program has provided planning assistance and funding to help plan, design, and construct Circuit Trail projects, thanks to financial support from the William Penn Foundation. For over a decade, the region has relied heavily on federal Transportation Alternatives Set-Aside (TASA or TAU) and Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funds to construct trail projects. As noted in your comments, the Draft FY2025 Pennsylvania TIP includes several large, county-led Circuit Trail projects, largely funded by the Carbon Reduction Program (CRP), a new federal formula program created by the IIJA/BIL that provides funding for projects designed to reduce transportation emissions. DVRPC’s Pennsylvania counties led the charge for this unprecedented investment in Circuit Trail projects to create a safe and efficient network for carbon-free travel. <br/><br/><br/>DVRPC applauds the counties and all the other stakeholders who are working hard to make the vision of the Circuit Trails network a reality.<br/><br/></div> <hr/><b><i>Response By Chester County</i></b><div>Thank you for your comments.

I can only imagine 18,000 more people, 8,000 more cars every other night looking for a spot like me.  Nightmare!<br/><br/>I can imagine a daytime 76ers game when there’s also an event at the Convention Center.  Gridlock from River to River!<br/><br/>On game nights and event nights, Chinatown patrons will expect to pay even more than you already do.  Do you think customers are going to frequent your Center City or Chinatown restaurant on game nights or event nights?. Heck no, they’re staying away from the parking and traffic congestion and going to eat somewhere else.  Customers are not going to order delivery either, because it could take too long to get the food.  The 76ers might be winners, but the local businesses will be the losers.<br/><br/>Wait until the arena comes and drives up the cost for folks that live in the area already.  76ers are proposing 347 housing units, with just 20% being “affordable', meaning 80% or 270 units being “not affordable” for most working class families.<br/><br/>The 76ers tout its plan for “affordable housing” that’s not the same as <br/><br/>“low-income housing” or “subsidized housing.”   <br/><br/>What is the proposed rental cost to live in the one or two bedroom apartments that are not considered “affordable housing units.”?  If you already live in the area, the 76ers are going to drive up the rent in nearby apartment units and drive current residents out of the neighborhood.  <br/><br/>As a homeowner, I'm paying over $4,000 a year in real estate taxes in Chinatown.   I'm not going to afford living there when the real estate taxes go up.<br/><br/>People experiencing a health emergency and trying to get to Jefferson or Penn Hospital in a hurry on a game night or event night might not survive the trip through all that congestion and proposed 10th and 11th street closures.<br/><br/>Chinatown and Center City residents will have to put up with the late night noise, traffic, congestion, trash, pandering, and other nuisances … their sacrifices are supposedly good for the City after all.  The 76ers owners are just glad it’s not “in their backyard.”<br/><br/>The 76ers owner says that they’ll still build a stadium, even if it isn’t downtown.  The 76ers can go somewhere else that makes sense.

The arena is not the only savior and option to revitalize Market East.  <br/><br/>The 76ers hype up its “Community Benefit Agreement” - $50 million over a 30 year lease. Do the math – that’s only $1.6 million a year that they are spreading across multiple entities and across the city and doing for their own benefit – not for the immediate Center City or Chinatown communities.<br/><br/>The 76ers are making promises or pledges, which there is no guarantee that they will keep.  The 76ers say the City is going to be the landlord and can hold them accountable.  The 76ers will hold all the cards.  The City won’t be in a position to do anything with an empty stadium.<br/><br/>How does the City benefit from being the landlord?  Does that mean the 76ers won’t pay real estate taxes, that the City will be stuck with a 30 year old building when the 76ers decide they need a newer facility (after all the 76ers are saying the xx year old Wells Fargo stadium is too old for them), that the City is responsible for whatever goes wrong with the building?<br/><br/>The 76ers are proposing a residential building but has produced no images of what the side looks like from the Chinatown side.", "MPMS":"", "FILELINK2":"", "Responses":"<div class='card'> <div class='mycard-header'> <b></b></div><div class='mycard-body'><b><i>Response By City of Philadelphia</i></b><div>Thank you for your submission.

The short term impacts (construction phase) will be disastrous for Chinatown and surrounding areas.  The long term impacts are likely to be extremely negative for Chinatown businesses and residents; no positive impact, other than for favored construction companies, is evident.  Parking is an enormous issue (no additional parking is contemplated) and the notion that the arena may somehow 'revitalize' downtown is a pipe dream spawned by the ego of the participants, not by any serious attempt to estimate impact.  An arena is a dead space throughout the daylight hours (in the middle of the city!) followed by extreme floods of cars and people who are not there to patronize local businesses, but - loigically enough - to watch an event.  Current clients of Chinatown restaurants, for example, will quickly recognize that any event day is not a day to visit Chinatown.

The proposed 76 Place arena is threatening Chinatown and the<br/><br/><br/>developers are trying to justify it with biased and bogus â¿¿impact studiesâ¿<br/><br/><br/>that they paid for. What the community needs are independent studies, with<br/><br/><br/>real data and analysis by truly independent parties. Instead of independent<br/><br/><br/>studies, the â¿¿impact studiesâ¿ that 76DevCorp paid for and the city<br/><br/><br/>government agreed to, rejected the need to examine how the arena would<br/><br/><br/>impact existing businesses, workers, and tax revenue in Chinatown,<br/><br/><br/>Washington Square West, and the surrounding area.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>As the regionâ¿¿s metropolitan planning organization for the Greater<br/><br/><br/>Philadelphia region, DVRPC should be responsible for evaluating 76 Placeâ¿¿s<br/><br/><br/>arena proposal, conduct modeling on the impact of the project, and report<br/><br/><br/>on the impacts of this monumental change to the region.

We appreciate that you noted there are exceptions where safety has been more significantly  considered. <br/><br/><br/>Safety is the goal of the Regional Vision Zero Plan and its partners, and  requires changing the business-as-usual approach in order  to shape all aspects of transportation planning to focus first on safety. DVRPC has had recent success with projects like Bicycle-Friendly Resurfacing (and its successor Complete Streets Evaluation) whereby we work with PennDOT to identify opportunities to add bike facilities and other CS improvements during annual repaving projects. This is important work initiated by PennDOT, and facilitated by DVRPC in coordination and collaboration with county and municipal partners. <br/><br/><br/>DVRPC is a planning agency and does not implement projects, but we know that through our studies and collaboration  our regional partners are perpetually more engaged on the topic and more conscious of the need to prioritize safety for vulnerable road users. DVRPC will continue to work with project sponsors and other partners to ensure that safety considerations are a focus for all projects. You too are our partner, and you bring an insightful perspective that inspires us and effects change that supports our pursuit of the Regional Vision Zero goal. Together we can make it happen.<br/><br/><br/></div> <hr/><b><i>Response By PennDOT</i></b><div>Thank you for your feedback regarding the implementation of a Safe System Approach to traffic safety.<br/><br/><br/>The department has embraced the Safe System Approach, recognizing its importance in creating safer roadways for all users, including vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians and cyclists.  An important factor in the Safer Roads component of this approach is considering the specific context of the roadway which includes the roadway’s role within the larger transportation network.  Balancing the need for mobility and safety is essential in determining roadway design.<br/><br/><br/>Mobility plays a crucial role in the planning process.  While safety is first and foremost priority on all projects, it is also essential to ensure that roadways can accommodate appropriate throughput without causing undue congestion.  Excessive congestion can lead to unintended consequences, such as diverting motor vehicle traffic onto alternative roadways not designed to accommodate larger volumes of traffic, thereby creating new safety concerns.  Achieving the appropriate balance between safety and mobility is indeed challenging but essential for an effective transportation system.<br/><br/><br/>Regarding the DVRPC's Vision Zero Policy, the department is dedicated to aligning projects with the goal of eliminating traffic fatalities and serious injuries.  While the FY 2025 TIP may have some projects that optimize traffic flow, the department also incorporates a safety review process as part of project delivery to reflect the principles of the Safe System Approach and Vision Zero.<br/><br/></div> <hr/></div></div>"},{"commentid":"443", "issueCount":"1", "responCount":"2", "commentor":"Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia", "AGENCY":"Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia", "comment":"Support the conversion to a roundabout.

Further, I and my fellow sports enthusiasts are proud to enjoy Philadelphia’s Stadium District: The Stadium District is the only one of its kind in any major city in the USA. It is the standard that other cities look to exemplify. The impressive collection of venues illicits the ‘wow’ factor from out-of-towners and affords Delaware Valley fans bragging rights. Further, the Stadium District provides we fans with a convenient choice of driving with plentuful parking or riding on public transport.<br/> The ranks of sports fans, like myself are swelled by working class people. As such we are decidedly pro jobs; just not at the expense of working class neighborhoods. Moreover, we are excited by the Comcast Corporation proposal to further develop and enhance the Stadium District, which will bring with it a plethora of desirable job creation. <br/> Commuting throughout Center City Philadelpha will become a nightmare. The extra influx of people on game days will greatly exacerbate existing transportation problems there and further burden an already strained infrastructure; especially when the surrounding system of roads are not slated for improvement by 76 Place. Moreover, we fans do not appreciate being told that we must relegate ourselves to taking public transport simply to accommodate the overwhelming and unecessary traffic congestion created by a 76 Place arena. <br/> Center City already lacks a sufficient number of parking spaces and the proposed network of digitally linked parking garages and associated consumer apps will not alleviate that shortage.

This is my 7th version, still it isn't totally up to date. My main idea is to make Upper Darby schools accessible by bicycle. So many kids here are driven to and from school even though there are buses available and schools are mainly within walking distance. It's like a third rush hour when the kids are picked up in the afternoon. Â Septa realized that if people take the bus when they're young they are more likely to use public transportation when adults, and this is even more true for bicycling.Â <br/><br/><br/>Some of this has been achieved but there's still a long way to go. There's a lot of fear here, but the prevalence of surveillance cameras, threatening signs and even just unnessary private property signs create a hostile environment for kids even playing outside. Closed, fast moving vehicles are immune to the effectrs of the unfriendly environment created by Â this intrusion for walking and biking.Â <br/><br/><br/>I had thought Marshall Rd would be a good route get closer to Lansdowne Ave Â for the high school students, and there looks like lanes on that road are coming. Marshall is interestinrg in that there are features that remind people of an on ramp to a freeway which causes people to speed up. I saw on the internet that Penndot has plans for protected bike lanes on Garrett Road coming soon. The 69th St bike lanes are good but not well used yet. The connection on the Baltimore Avenue end is awkward. The new off road bike path below Marshall Rd west of Â Long Lane is delightful but doesn't connect well to the neighborhoods. The only cut through is through the playground. Â  There are unmarked lanes on Lansdowne Ave between Bond and West Chester Pike but they aren't much used since the sidealk on that stretch is bikable, But Lansdowne Bourough's brave lanes below Garrett are bringing a bike route to the high school a bit closer. The stretches adjacent to the high school are still treacherous.Â <br/><br/><br/>The Bicycle Coalition's newest approach is to focus on difficult intersections between neighborhoods and let the bicyclists navigate the quieter neighborhood streets, rather than focus on longer bike lanes, parallel and adjacent to major thoroughfares. I like this approach but there are drawbacks, getting lost, finding yourself on a one way street with no ther option (this still happens to me after 22 years). Cut-throughs and alleys improve a bicycle network Â a lot. Many cut-throughs have been fenced as have the ones on my block, which eliminates their use for transportation or play.Â <br/><br/><br/>Bicycling can be a lonely sport, bcause the speed differential is such that 2 bicyclists starting out at the same time from close proximity will rarely meet. Â As a response I did an experimental project of creating decals from recycled plastic bottles and the glue squares used to attach reflectors on highways to try to guide bicyclists through cut-throughs or places that appear dangerous but connect to bike routes. I put out about 20 of them, using straight, left turn and right turn symbols. My idea would be to have the colors indicate the cardinal directions. M experiment coincided with the repaving of many streets in Upper Darby so some of them had short lives. A few have survived the 5 years, but only a mother would recognize them. They can be applied with heat, readily in 100 degree weather. Â I think encourging and normalizing bicyling can be helped with small Â fun touches, for instance riding on a colored pavement is quite fun.<br/><br/><br/>I think the cultural aspects of encouraging bicycling are probably as important as infrastructure going forward. As a woman bicyclist I've received systematic shaming in my neighborhooda by people who don't think a woman should ride a bicycle. I had written up a plan for Upper Darby to hire a Bicycle Coordinator, which wasn't accepted so far. Â After planning my 'bicycle book' for many years it now exists as a video Â  sunday bicycle outing of mo and ra greenbein Â  Â Â https://vimeo.com/279176542 Â https://vimeo.com/279176542Â Â  I wanted to show how fun bicyling is as well as what you need to get started, but I found it difficult to combine the 2 so the first part is the fun and the Appendix is tips for getting started. This little video is Creative Commons so can be used for free.<br/><br/><br/>Although I live very close to one of the premiere transportaition centers in the US, people spend a lot of time griping about parking and many consider travel by public transportation to be demeaning. Driving is a big part of the American Dream, those with access to alternatives would seem to be the ones to lead the way.<br/><br/><br/>The circuit trails are well planned, and how fortunate we are to have the Bicycle Coalition as an ally.

For over a decade, the region has relied heavily on federal Transportation Alternatives Set-Aside (TASA or TAU) and Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funds to construct trail projects. As noted in your comments, the Draft FY2025 Pennsylvania TIP includes several large, county-led Circuit Trail projects, largely funded by the Carbon Reduction Program (CRP), a new federal formula program created by the IIJA/BIL that provides funding for projects designed to reduce transportation emissions. DVRPC’s Pennsylvania counties led the charge for this unprecedented investment in Circuit Trail projects to create a safe and efficient network for carbon-free travel. <br/><br/><br/>DVRPC applauds the counties and all the other stakeholders who are working hard to make the vision of the Circuit Trails network a reality.<br/><br/></div> <hr/><b><i>Response By Chester County</i></b><div>Thank you for your comments.

As noted in your comments, the Draft FY2025 Pennsylvania TIP includes several large, county-led Circuit Trail projects, largely funded by the Carbon Reduction Program (CRP), a new federal formula program created by the IIJA/BIL that provides funding for projects designed to reduce transportation emissions. DVRPC’s Pennsylvania counties led the charge for this unprecedented investment in Circuit Trail projects to create a safe and efficient network for carbon-free travel. <br/><br/><br/>DVRPC applauds the counties and all the other stakeholders who are working hard to make the vision of the Circuit Trails network a reality.<br/><br/></div> <hr/><b><i>Response By Chester County</i></b><div>Thank you for your comments.

Thank you<br/><br/><br/>for considering public input to the long range planning process now<br/><br/><br/>underway. We have grave concerns particularly in regard to transportation,<br/><br/><br/>traffic, and streets. . The Save Chinatown Coalition has submitted numerous<br/><br/><br/>Right to Know Requests which have largely been denied. As well, while<br/><br/><br/>someone was able to get the initial transportation study done by Langan on<br/><br/><br/>behalf of the developers of 76 Place, subsequent requests for updated<br/><br/><br/>studies and communication in regard to the studies have been denied. We are<br/><br/><br/>in the process of appealing these denials.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Nonetheless, we were able to get some documents which raised substantial<br/><br/><br/>questions in regard to the arena project and effects on the Chinatown<br/><br/><br/>community and. I will share these questions below and hope you work to<br/><br/><br/>ensure adequate responses to these questions.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>   1.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>   The original plan for closure of 10th and 11th streets during events as<br/><br/><br/>   well as a subsequent suggestion that they would keep one lane open raises<br/><br/><br/>   the following concerns:<br/><br/><br/>   1.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>      A key point of SEPTAâ¿¿s  current Bus Revolution network redesign (and<br/><br/><br/>      the Cityâ¿¿s Transit Plan) is to have a simpler, more  reliable, and<br/><br/><br/>      consistent network. Route 47, operating north and south on these<br/><br/><br/>      streets, is on the City's Transit Priority list in the Transit<br/><br/><br/>Plan. These<br/><br/><br/>      are some of the highest ridership streets in all of the City. This is<br/><br/><br/>      proposed as a 10 Max route in Bus Revolution. Regularly detouring a<br/><br/><br/>      high ridership 10MAX route stands  directly in contrast to this<br/><br/><br/>initiative. Even<br/><br/><br/>      partial closures and increased congestion will affect this bus<br/><br/><br/>line. How is<br/><br/><br/>      this being addressed?<br/><br/><br/>      2.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>      It would require detours on to Market Street and either north on 13th<br/><br/><br/>      or 9th Streets. The latter would require turning at Chestnut Street and<br/><br/><br/>      would take away access to a current end of line used by Route 23.How will<br/><br/><br/>      this affect the Cityâ¿¿s long term transit plan?<br/><br/><br/>      3.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>      In the case of detouring a 10 Max route, is this in keeping with the<br/><br/><br/>      spirit of the City's Transit Plan?<br/><br/><br/>      2.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>   Widening of the east-side the of 11th Street sidewalk and the west side<br/><br/><br/>   of 10th street sidewalk from 13' to 22' will reduce curb to curb width.<br/><br/><br/>   This is also concerning.<br/><br/><br/>   1.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>      Two lanes must be maintained, but will the removal of parking.drop<br/><br/><br/>      off points turn the right lane into a de facto stopping lane and<br/><br/><br/>impede the<br/><br/><br/>      flow of buses and bike lanes?.<br/><br/><br/>      3.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>   They propose taking Filbert Street. Space towards Filbert Street is<br/><br/><br/>   already regularly used by double decker tourist buses and event charters.<br/><br/><br/>   Any relocation puts them in competition with SEPTA at other locations for<br/><br/><br/>   limited curb space. How has this been addressed?<br/><br/><br/>   4.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>   Will a capacity analysis be done to determine if the trainsets needed to<br/><br/><br/>   support the arena demand can be facilitated at the existing stations?<br/><br/><br/>   5.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>   Double parking, illegal turns and other problematic behaviors cannot be<br/><br/><br/>   totally controlled by enforcement. While those also occur at present,<br/><br/><br/>   anything that deteriorates the existing conditions is of concern and<br/><br/><br/>   warrants addressing for possible mitigation. Narrower cartways, detours and<br/><br/><br/>   changes in traffic flows have the potential to concentrate more of that<br/><br/><br/>   activity on major surface transit corridors.How will this impact long range<br/><br/><br/>   use or the area?<br/><br/><br/>   6.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>   The developers have asked for a reclassification of Market Street East<br/><br/><br/>   as a â¿¿localâ¿ road (vs. its current status as a state (PennDOT) controlled<br/><br/><br/>   road.  Market Street is designated an emergency route, and carries many of<br/><br/><br/>   our public transportation  buses. As well, as a state controlled road,<br/><br/><br/>   there are existing restrictions in regard to lighted billboards and signage<br/><br/><br/>   due to the, historic status of this area. How will this change in<br/><br/><br/>   designation affect Market Street?<br/><br/><br/>   7.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>   18,500 people will be leaving events at the same time. Where is<br/><br/><br/>   designated taxi/ride share pick up being located? Are sidewalks in this<br/><br/><br/>   area sufficiently wide to accommodate that number of people? Will there be<br/><br/><br/>   an issue in regard to pedestrian safety?<br/><br/><br/>   8.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>   How have they addressed existing  curbside uses, SEPTA operations,<br/><br/><br/>   sidewalk pedestrian capacity, etc?<br/><br/><br/>   9.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>   There is a Fire Department station  located at 133 N. 10th Street. There<br/><br/><br/>   are also 4 different emergency rooms in this area that will be impacted:<br/><br/><br/>   Wills Eye, Pennsylvania Hospital and Jefferon. As well, Jefferson is<br/><br/><br/>   currently the only Level 1 Trauma emergency treatment center in the area.<br/><br/><br/>   Has there been an analysis of both increase in emergency room visits as<br/><br/><br/>   well as increased use of emergency vehicles during large events?<br/><br/><br/>   10.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>   What is the plan for proposed 2 years of demolition and 4 years of<br/><br/><br/>   construction in regard to street closures/blockages/alterations?<br/><br/><br/>   11.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>   Since COVID, 30% of Chinatown restaurant  businesses relay on<br/><br/><br/>   takeout/pick up services. This requires the ability to find on street<br/><br/><br/>   temporary parking and easy ingress and egress to streets surrounding<br/><br/><br/>   Chinatown. How will the traffic created by the proposed 150 events a year<br/><br/><br/>   affect the business corridors?<br/><br/><br/>   12.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>   The arena will be empty more than half the year. What will be done to<br/><br/><br/>   ensure the area does not become another â¿¿dead zoneâ¿ similar to the<br/><br/><br/>   Convention Center? Why, if the mall is failing, does the developer believe<br/><br/><br/>   retail spaces will be sufficient or successful in addressing this issue?<br/><br/><br/>   13.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>   With the Chinatown Stitch being underway, how will traffic operate in<br/><br/><br/>   the area?<br/><br/><br/>   14.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>   Will DVRPC investigate and identify those most serious levels of traffic<br/><br/><br/>   congestion and pedestrian safety that could result from the construction of<br/><br/><br/>   76 Place? This would not only include local street intersection issues, but<br/><br/><br/>   also issues involving the Interstate system such as I-95, I-76 and<br/><br/><br/>   I-676.With 76, I-95 entrance and exit ramps and Ben Franklin Bridge traffic<br/><br/><br/>   all in the immediate area, how will this affect traffic, parking and<br/><br/><br/>   respiratory health of residents in the area - Chinatown and beyond?<br/><br/><br/>   15.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>   Part of your vision is to â¿¿protect and preserve our natural resources<br/><br/><br/>   while creating healthy communities; and foster greater opportunities for<br/><br/><br/>   all.â¿ Chinatown is a 150 year old residential and business community.<br/><br/><br/>   Adjacent are some of the USâ¿¿s most precious historical sites. Will DVRPC<br/><br/><br/>   investigate the impact of this proposal on these particular parts of the<br/><br/><br/>   Commission's charge?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>There are many other areas of concern for us as we have had two years to<br/><br/><br/>study this project. We would be happy to meet with you to discuss this<br/><br/><br/>further.
